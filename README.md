Portfolio Page

This was my first stab at a portfolio site. 
The site includes three pages- About Me (index), Contact and Portfolio.

It was created using BootStrap 4. I used BootStrap primarily for the contact form, the grid system, the footer and nav bar.

I tried to keep the design minimal. I used white because it conveys a sense of luxury. I created some of my own graphics to make it feel a little more "artsy". 

This is a responsive design.

Here is a screenshot of the index page:
